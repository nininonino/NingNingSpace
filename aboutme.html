                    Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm so glad you're here. 
                    Let me share a bit about who I am and what makes me... well, me!
                </p>

                    Hi! My name is Nurul Najwa Ayuni binti Ibaharim@Ibrahim. Some people ask, “Why Nini?” Well… it just stuck, and honestly, I kinda like it! But you can also call me Nurul, Najwa, Ayuni… or Princess, if you're feeling fancy. 😌✨I’m 20 years old, proudly from Perak, and just someone who enjoys the little things in life. I love keeping things light, having fun, and finding small moments that make every day feel a bit happier.
                </p>
                
             <h3>🎀 My Personality</h3>

<p>
                <p>
                    People often describe me as creative, friendly, playful, and passionate, but honestly, I’m more of an easy-going, warm person once you get to know me. I love learning new things, having fun, and enjoying the little cute moments in life.

Even though I can be playful and outgoing, I’m actually shy and introverted at first. Sometimes I need a little nudge or for someone to talk to me first before I start laughing and opening up. 😆 Once I’m comfortable, I’m super chill, approachable, and easy to get along with. I really enjoy connecting with people who share the same vibes and values, and I always try to spread good energy wherever I go. 💗✨
                </p>
                
              <h3>💭 My Dreams & Goals</h3>

                <p>
                    Looking ahead, I dream of having a stable, meaningful career that allows me to support myself and, most importantly, take care of my parents. I want to make them proud, make them happy, and help them achieve the dreams they had to set aside while raising our family. One of my biggest goals in life is to give back to my parents, to fulfil the things they wished for but never got the chance to experience.
I also want a better, brighter future where I’m not only able to stand on my own feet, but also able to help people who are struggling, especially those who need kindness, support, and hope. I believe success means nothing if I can’t use it to lift others up. Step by step, I’m working towards a life where I can provide, contribute, and spread goodness wherever I go. 💕
